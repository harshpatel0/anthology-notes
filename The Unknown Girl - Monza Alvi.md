# The Unknown Girl - Monza Alvi

## Summary

Monizo Alri was born in Pakistan. Her father was Pakistani and her mother was an English. She left Pakistan when she was a few months old to live in England.
She had used some of her poems as tools to explore cultural identity. Although this poem is set in India, it appeals autobiographical in tone as the narrator feels that her cultural roots and traditions are being reaffirmed and reawakened in the Bazaar by the Unknown Girl hennaing of her hand. 
This new lease of life even fitters through the description of the market as she brings it alive with her new found energy and confidence *"I'll lean across the country with hands outstretched"*

## Structure and Form

The poem is free verse written. This suits the narrator's explanation of thought flowing as one long verse like a stream of consciousness (Internal Monologue) as she described what's happening to and around her.The poem has a visually pleasing layout and thats reminiscent (To remind you of something) or her newly decoraed hennated hand. 
The single verse style effectively maintains the links between the narrator (speaker) and the bazaar with all the cultural association here else the series of verses would break this precious connection

## Language Use

The poem's vocabulary immediately places into a foreign exotic location (Bazaar in India). *"Bazaar, kameez, rupees"* indicate the setting

**Senses** - Textures are often described appealing to her sense of touch *"She squeezes wet brown line... on her Satin peach knee"*

**Contrast / Juxtapostion** - The narrator also contrasts sound *"furious... hushed"*. Colourful magic comes alive *"peacock, balloon, amber bird" contrasted to brown (dull colour)*
